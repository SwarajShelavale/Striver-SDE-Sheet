# Problem Name: [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

## Description
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has a size equal to m + n such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from nums2.

## Approach
1. Initialize pointers `i`, `j`, and `k` to `m - 1`, `n - 1`, and `m + n - 1`, respectively.
2. Iterate through both arrays from right to left:
   - Compare the elements at indices `i` in `nums1` and `j` in `nums2`.
   - If the element at `nums1[i]` is greater than the element at `nums2[j]`, place `nums1[i]` at position `k` and decrement `i`.
   - Otherwise, place `nums2[j]` at position `k` and decrement `j`.
   - Decrement `k` after each placement.
3. If there are elements remaining in `nums2` after the first loop, copy them to the beginning of `nums1`.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int k = m + n - 1;
        int i = m - 1, j = n - 1;

        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                nums1[k] = nums1[i];
                nums1[i] = 0; // Set the original position to 0 after moving the element
                i--;
            } else {
                nums1[k] = nums2[j];
                j--;
            }
            k--;
        }

        while (j >= 0) {
            nums1[k] = nums2[j];
            j--;
            k--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(m + n), where m is the size of `nums1` and n is the size of `nums2`.
