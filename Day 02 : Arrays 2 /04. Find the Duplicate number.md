# Problem Name: [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive, prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the first element of the array.
2. Use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm to detect the cycle in the array:
   - Move `slow` one step forward and `fast` two steps forward in each iteration until they meet.
3. Once `slow` and `fast` meet, there is a cycle.
4. Reset one pointer to the start of the array and keep the other pointer where it is.
5. Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point will be the duplicate number.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = 0, fast = 0;
        while (true) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }
        int beginCycle = 0;
        while (true) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            beginCycle = nums[beginCycle];
            if (beginCycle == slow)
                return beginCycle;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
