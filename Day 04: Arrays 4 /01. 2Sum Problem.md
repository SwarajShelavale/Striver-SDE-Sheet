# Problem Name: [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Approach
Use a HashMap to store the indices of elements as we traverse the array. For each element `nums[i]`, check if `target - nums[i]` is present in the HashMap. If it is, return the indices of the current element and the complement found in the HashMap.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int ans[] = new int[2];

        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                ans[0] = i;
                ans[1] = map.get(target - nums[i]);
                break;
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
- Space complexity: O(n) since we use a HashMap to store elements and their indices.
