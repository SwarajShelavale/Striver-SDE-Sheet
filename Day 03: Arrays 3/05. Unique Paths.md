# Problem Name: [Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## Problem Description
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

## Approach
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- Create a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n`.
- Initialize the first row and first column of `dp` with 1, since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column.
- For other cells in the grid, the number of unique paths to reach the current cell is the sum of the number of unique paths to reach the cell above it and the cell to its left.
- Traverse the grid to fill in the values of `dp`.
- The value at the bottom-right corner of the grid will be the number of unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0)
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                else
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }

        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space complexity: O(m * n) since we use a 2D array of size m x n to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell.
