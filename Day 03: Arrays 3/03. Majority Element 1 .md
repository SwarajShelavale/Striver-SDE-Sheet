# Problem Name: [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

## Problem Description
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Approach
Use Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:
- Initialize a counter variable `count` to 1 and a `majorityElement` variable to `nums[0]`.
- Iterate through the array from the second element.
- If the current element is equal to the `majorityElement`, increment the `count`.
- If the current element is not equal to the `majorityElement`, decrement the `count`.
  - If `count` becomes 0, update the `majorityElement` to the current element and reset `count` to 1.
- The `majorityElement` at the end of the loop will be the majority element.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int count = 1;
        int majorityElement = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == majorityElement)
                count++;
            else {
                count--;
                if (count == 0) {
                    majorityElement = nums[i];
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return majorityElement;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the algorithm uses only constant space.
