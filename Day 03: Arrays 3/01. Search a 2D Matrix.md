# Problem Name: [Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/)

## Problem Description
Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

## Approach
1. Perform binary search in the 2D matrix.
2. Initialize `start` to 0 and `end` to n * m - 1.
3. While `start` is less than or equal to `end`, calculate `mid` as `start + (end - start) / 2`.
4. Convert `mid` to row and column indices.
5. Compare the element at matrix[row][col] with the target.
6. If they are equal, return true.
7. If the element is less than the target, update `start` to `mid + 1`.
8. If the element is greater than the target, update `end` to `mid - 1`.
9. Repeat the process until `start` is greater than `end`.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
       int n = matrix.length;
       int m = matrix[0].length;
       int start = 0, end = n * m - 1;

       while (start <= end) {
           int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

           int row = mid / m;
           int col = mid % m;

            if (matrix[row][col] == target)
                return true;
            else if (matrix[row][col] < target)
                start = mid + 1;
            else
                end = mid - 1;
       }

       return false;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(log (n * m)), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns in the matrix.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the algorithm uses only constant space.
