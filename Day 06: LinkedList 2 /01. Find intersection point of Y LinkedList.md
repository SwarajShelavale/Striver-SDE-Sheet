# Problem Name: [Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

## Problem Description
Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins. If there is no intersection point, return null.



## Approach
To find the intersection point of two linked lists:
1. Find the lengths of both linked lists.
2. Move the pointer of the longer list ahead by the difference in lengths.
3. Traverse both lists simultaneously until a common node is found.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        ListNode curA = headA, curB = headB;

        // Find length of both linked lists
        int lengthA = findLength(curA), lengthB = findLength(curB);
        
        // Move ahead the longer linked list till difference
        if (lengthA > lengthB)
            curA = travelDifference(curA, lengthA - lengthB);
        else
            curB = travelDifference(curB, lengthB - lengthA);
        
        // Until common node, move ahead each node
        while (curA != null && curB != null) {
            if (curA == curB)
                return curA;
            curA = curA.next;
            curB = curB.next;
        }
        return null;
    }

    public int findLength(ListNode node) {
        int length = 0;
        while (node != null) {
            length++;
            node = node.next;
        }
        return length;
    }

    public ListNode travelDifference(ListNode node, int diff) {
        while (node != null && diff > 0) {
            node = node.next;
            diff--;
        }
        return node;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists respectively. We traverse each linked list once to find their lengths and then traverse both lists simultaneously.
- Space complexity: O(1). We use only constant space for pointers and variables.
