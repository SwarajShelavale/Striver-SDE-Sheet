# Problem Name: [Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

## Problem Description
Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

## Approach
To detect the node where the cycle begins:
1. Initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both starting from the head of the linked list.
2. Move slow by one step and fast by two steps until they meet or fast reaches the end of the list.
3. If fast reaches the end of the list, return null as there is no cycle.
4. When slow and fast meet, reset one of the pointers to the head of the list.
5. Move both pointers at the same pace until they meet again. The meeting point will be the node where the cycle begins.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {            
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }

        if (fast == null || fast.next == null)
            return null;

        fast = head;
        while (fast != slow) {
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list twice.
- Space complexity: O(1), we use only constant extra space for pointers.
