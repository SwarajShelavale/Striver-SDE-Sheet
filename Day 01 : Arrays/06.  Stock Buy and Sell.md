# Problem Name: [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

## Description
You are given an array `prices` where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Approach
1. Initialize variables `profit`, `i`, and `j`.
2. Start iterating through the array from the second element.
3. Compare the price at index `j` with the price at index `i`.
4. If the price at index `j` is greater than the price at index `i`, calculate the profit by subtracting the price at index `i` from the price at index `j`. Update `profit` with the maximum of the current profit and the calculated profit.
5. If the price at index `j` is less than or equal to the price at index `i`, update `i` to `j`.
6. Increment `j`.
7. Repeat the process until `j` reaches the end of the array.
8. Return `profit`.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;

        while (j < prices.length) {
            if (prices[i] < prices[j]) {
                profit = Math.max(profit, prices[j] - prices[i]);
            } else {
                i = j;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `prices`.
