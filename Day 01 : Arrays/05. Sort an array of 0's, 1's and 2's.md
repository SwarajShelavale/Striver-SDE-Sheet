# Problem Name : [Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

## Description
Given an array `nums` with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue. Here, 0 represents red, 1 represents white, and 2 represents blue.

## Approach
1. Initialize three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
2. Initialize `low` and `mid` to 0, and `high` to the last index of the array `nums`.
3. Iterate through the array while `mid` is less than or equal to `high`.
4. If `nums[mid]` is 0, swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[low]`, and increment both `low` and `mid`.
5. If `nums[mid]` is 2, swap `nums[mid]` with `nums[high]`, and decrement `high`.
6. If `nums[mid]` is 1, increment `mid`.
7. Repeat the process until `mid` is greater than `high`.

## Java Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length - 1;

        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                int temp = nums[low];
                nums[low] = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = temp;
                mid++;
                low++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 2) {
                int temp = nums[mid];
                nums[mid] = nums[high];
                nums[high] = temp;
                high--;
            } else {
                mid++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
