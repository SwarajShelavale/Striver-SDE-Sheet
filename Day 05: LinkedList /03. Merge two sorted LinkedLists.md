# Problem Name: [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

## Problem Description
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

## Approach
- Use two pointers to traverse both lists simultaneously.
- Compare the values of the nodes at the current positions of the pointers and append the smaller node to the new merged list.
- Move the pointer of the smaller node forward. Repeat this process until one of the lists becomes null.
- Append the remaining nodes of the non-empty list to the merged list.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        if (l1 == null)
            return l2;
        else if (l2 == null)
            return l1;
        
        ListNode head = null;
        ListNode tail = null;
        ListNode cur1 = l1;
        ListNode cur2 = l2;
        
        if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
            head = cur1;
            tail = cur1;
            cur1 = cur1.next;
        } else {
            head = cur2;
            tail = cur2;
            cur2 = cur2.next;
        }

        while (cur1 != null && cur2 != null) {
            if (cur1.val < cur2.val) {
                tail.next = cur1;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur1 = cur1.next;
            } else {
                tail.next = cur2;
                tail = tail.next;
                cur2 = cur2.next;
            }
        }

        if (cur1 == null)
            tail.next = cur2;
        else
            tail.next = cur1;

        return head;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two linked lists.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the algorithm uses only constant space.
