# Problem Name: [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

## Problem Description
Given the head of a singly-linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

## Approach
Use the slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle node of the linked list. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: O(1) since the algorithm uses only constant space.
