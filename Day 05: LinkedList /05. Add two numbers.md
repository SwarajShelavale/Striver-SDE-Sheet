# Problem Name: [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)

## Problem Description
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

## Approach
Traverse both linked lists simultaneously while there are nodes in either list or there is a carry from the previous sum. At each step, calculate the sum of the corresponding digits from both lists along with the carry, update the carry, and create a new node with the digit of the sum. Move to the next nodes in both lists.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode node1, ListNode node2) {
       int carry = 0;
       ListNode newHead = new ListNode(0), cur = newHead;
       while (node1 != null || node2 != null) {
           int sum = 0;
           if (node1 != null) {
               sum += node1.val;
               node1 = node1.next;
           }

           if (node2 != null) {
               sum += node2.val;
               node2 = node2.next;
           }

           cur.next = new ListNode((sum + carry) % 10);
           carry = (sum + carry) / 10;
           cur = cur.next;
       }
       if (carry == 1) {
           cur.next = new ListNode(1);
       }

       return newHead.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(max(m, n)), where m and n are the lengths of the two input lists.
- Space complexity: O(max(m, n)), the space used by the new list.
