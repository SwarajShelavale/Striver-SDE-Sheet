# Problem Name: [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

## Problem Description
Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, only access to the node to be deleted.

## Approach
To delete a node from a linked list without having access to the head of the list:
- Copy the value of the next node to the node to be deleted.
- Update the next pointer of the node to be deleted to skip the next node, effectively removing it from the list.

## Java Solution
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: O(1). The deletion operation takes constant time as we only need to update the value and pointers of the given node.
- Space complexity: O(1). We do not use any extra space beyond a few pointers.
